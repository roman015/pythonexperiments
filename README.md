# pythonexperiments
A place to leave a bunch of python experiments that mark my journey of mastering python.


## So how do you plan to do that?

By failing, copy pasting code, reading documentation, anything that I can get my hands on.
This will be a journey of a thousand steps (or missteps? Either way it's still learning!)

## What is your setup like?

Right now I'm using VS2015 and Python 3.6
